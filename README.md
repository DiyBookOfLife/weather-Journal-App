# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This Weather-Journal App showcases my ability to build an asynchronous web application that interacts with an external API (OpenWeather API) and user-generated data to dynamically update the user interface. It demonstrates my skills in:
- **Web APIs Integration**
- **Dynamic UI Updates**
- **JavaScript Asynchronous Programming**
- **Node.js Backend Development**

While the HTML and CSS files were provided by Udacity, all backend logic and app functionality—including `server.js`, `website/app.js`, and additional JavaScript logic—are fully custom-built by me.

## Features
- Fetch real-time weather data from OpenWeather API based on user input.
- Store and retrieve user journal entries alongside weather data.
- Dynamically update the UI with both API data and user input.
- Utilize asynchronous JavaScript for smooth interactions.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **API**: OpenWeather API
- **Other Tools**: Postman, GitHub

## Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DiyBookOfLife/weather-journal-app.git
2. Install dependencies: 
    ```bash
    npm install
3. Start server: 
    ```bash
    node server.js
4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to access the app.

## How It Works
1. User enters a zip code and journal entry.
2. The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API.
3. Weather data and journal entry are stored in the server and displayed dynamically on the frontend.
