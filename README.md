# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This is my Weather-Journal App project, created to showcase my ability to build an asynchronous web application that interacts with an external API and user data to dynamically update the user interface. In this project, I demonstrate my skills in working with Web APIs, handling user data, and utilizing JavaScript to create interactive and dynamic web experiences. The HTML and CSS files were provided by Udacity, but all other files in the project, including server.js, website/app.js, and the custom logic, are my own work.

## Instructions
To get started, I modified the server.js file and the website/app.js file. The index.html file provides the necessary element references for the app, and once the functionality is in place, the style.css (provided by Udacity) is used to customize the look and feel of the application.
